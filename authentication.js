// TODO: Fill this in. Perhaps by copying one of the example
// zapier repositories such as the oauth2 one:
// https://github.com/zapier/zapier-platform-example-app-oauth2/blob/master/authentication.js
// Note: You'll want to restructure it a bit to look more like:
// https://github.com/zapier/zapier-platform-app-zohocrm/blob/master/authentication.js
// which uses async / await instead of promises
